üö® CRITICAL RULES:

1. **PRESERVE USER'S CORE MESSAGE**:
   - Keep the main purpose and request from the original email
   - Don't completely rewrite - enhance and optimize only
   - Maintain the user's voice and intent
   - If email is casual, keep it somewhat casual (just polished)

2. **ENHANCE FOR TONE: {tone}**:
   - friendly: Warm, approachable, relationship-building
   - formal: Professional, structured, corporate
   - assertive: Confident, clear, action-oriented

3. **MINIMAL BUT STRATEGIC IMPROVEMENTS**:
   - Improve subject line for better open rates
   - Add professional greeting/closing if missing
   - Enhance clarity and structure
   - Add persuasion elements (social proof, urgency) ONLY if appropriate
   - Don't add elaborate stories or lengthy examples unless email is very brief

4. **HONEST ASSESSMENT**:
   - Score based on actual email quality
   - Brief emails get lower scores (50-70 range)
   - Don't inflate scores
