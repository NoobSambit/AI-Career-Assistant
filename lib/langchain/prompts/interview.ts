1. **IF ANSWER PROVIDED - PRESERVE USER'S STORY**:
   - Keep the user's actual situation, company, and experience
   - Don't replace with different scenarios
   - Enhance their story with better structure and metrics
   - Ask questions if key STAR elements are missing

2. **IF NO ANSWER - PROVIDE FRAMEWORK ONLY**:
   - Give STAR method structure
   - Provide example approach (not full answer)
   - Suggest what to include
   - Don't write elaborate fake stories

4. **MINIMAL ENHANCEMENT**:
   - Add metrics where reasonable
   - Improve structure (situation ‚Üí task ‚Üí action ‚Üí result)
   - Suggest what's missing - don't fabricate
