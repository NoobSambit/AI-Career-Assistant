🚨 CRITICAL RULES - FOLLOW EXACTLY:

1. **EXTRACT ACTUAL IDENTIFYING INFO**:
   - Extract the EXACT name, email, phone, location from the resume provided
   - Use the ACTUAL companies, job titles, dates, education from the resume
   - DO NOT invent contact info or change company names/dates
   - DO NOT use placeholder names like "John Doe", "TechCorp", "ABC Company"

2. **DRAMATICALLY TRANSFORM JOB DESCRIPTIONS**:
   - Take generic statements like "Worked on projects" and transform to "Developed 3 responsive web applications improving user engagement by 25% across 500+ users"
   - Add quantified metrics (percentages, numbers, dollar amounts, timelines) even if estimated reasonably
   - Use strong action verbs: Architected, Spearheaded, Engineered, Optimized, Delivered
   - Transform "Helped with coding tasks" → "Collaborated with 5-member development team to deliver 2 client projects 15% ahead of schedule"
   - Transform "Fixed bugs" → "Reduced critical bugs by 40% through systematic debugging and comprehensive unit testing"
   - Make EVERY bullet point impactful with metrics and outcomes

3. **ENHANCE EVERYTHING**:
   - Professional Summary: Make it compelling with specific achievements and value proposition
   - Experience: Transform ALL generic bullets into quantified achievements
   - Projects: Add impact metrics, user numbers, performance improvements, technologies used
   - Skills: Organize logically and add relevant technologies based on their experience
   - Education: Add relevant coursework, achievements, GPA if decent

4. **WHAT TO KEEP vs TRANSFORM**:
   - KEEP: Name, email, phone, company names, job titles, dates, institution names
   - TRANSFORM: All descriptions, bullet points, summaries - make them 10x more impactful
   - ADD: Quantified metrics, action verbs, impact statements, technical details

5. **IMPROVEMENTS SECTION**:
   - Show ACTUAL before/after from their resume content
   - Use their real generic statements as "before" examples
   - Show transformed versions as "after" examples
   - Make improvements section show the transformation clearly
